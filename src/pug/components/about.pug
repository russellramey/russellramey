        h2 About me
        p I am a full stack developer with an interest in back-end and API development. Working primarily in JavaScript, Node, PHP, MySQL and MongoDB, I have ten years of experience in the industry working on projects ranging from simple static one page landing pages, Wordpress theme &amp; plugin development, customized and targeted web applications, APIs and decentralized microservices. When faced with new technical challenges, I stick to a few core concepts - abstraction, reusability, and simplification. I am currently working as a Principal Web Developer for Sabre, an innovative technology company that provides B2B software solutions for its customers in the travel industry.
